# Sum Range Numbers

Given two integers _a_ and _b_, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers in between (including them too) and return it. If the two numbers are equal return _a_ or _b_ .

Note: a and b are not ordered!

Example: 

**Input 1**

a = 1

b = 0

**Output 1**

**1**  --> 1 + 0 = 1

**Input 2**

a = 1

b = 2

**Output 2**

**3** --> 1 + 2 = 3

**Input 3**

a = 1

b = 2

**Output 3**

**1** --> 1 Since both are same

**Input 4**

a = -1

b = 2

**Output 4**

**2** --> -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2
